# 3DP_Swerve
3D Printed Drivetrain designed to move in any direction
<br>
The following images show the mechanical design of each module. It consists of two small brushed DC motors to control the heading of the wheel, along with a single BLDC motor for driving the wheel itself. Hall effect encoders are used to measure the raw heading as well as the rotational velocity of the wheel.
